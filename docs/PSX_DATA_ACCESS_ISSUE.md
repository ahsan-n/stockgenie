# PSX Data Access Issue - October 16, 2025

## Problem
Unable to access dps.psx.com.pk from development environment.

## Technical Details

### DNS Resolution
- ✅ Domain resolves: `52.128.23.16`
- ❌ Ping: 100% packet loss  
- ❌ HTTP/HTTPS: Connection timeout (15+ seconds)

### Tested URLs
- `https://dps.psx.com.pk` - TIMEOUT
- `https://www.psx.com.pk` - TIMEOUT

## Possible Causes

1. **Geographic Restrictions**
   - Site may block non-Pakistani IPs
   - Common for financial data portals

2. **Firewall Rules**
   - Site may have strict firewall
   - Blocks automated/bot requests

3. **VPN/Proxy Required**
   - May need Pakistan-based VPN
   - Or proxy service

4. **Site Down/Slow**
   - Temporary outage
   - Server performance issues

## Solutions

### Option A: User Tests Access (RECOMMENDED)
**User should test from their location:**

```bash
# Test 1: Can you access in browser?
open https://dps.psx.com.pk/?page_id=30

# Test 2: Test from your terminal
curl -v "https://dps.psx.com.pk/?page_id=30"

# Test 3: Test with Python
python3 -c "import requests; print(requests.get('https://dps.psx.com.pk', timeout=10).status_code)"
```

**If successful**: Provide HTML sample so I can build the scraper

### Option B: Try Yahoo Finance (FALLBACK)
```python
import yfinance as yf
# Try these ticker symbols:
symbols = ['^KSE100', 'KSE100.KA', '100.KA', 'PSX100']
for symbol in symbols:
    try:
        ticker = yf.Ticker(symbol)
        info = ticker.info
        print(f"{symbol}: {info}")
    except:
        print(f"{symbol}: Not found")
```

### Option C: Alternative Data Sources

1. **Business Recorder API**
   - URL: https://www.brecorder.com
   - May have easier access

2. **Investing.com**
   - Has KSE100 data
   - Might be more accessible

3. **Manual API**
   - User provides API endpoint if they have one
   - Or shares API credentials

### Option D: VPN/Proxy Solution
- Use Pakistan-based VPN
- Use proxy service (costs money)
- Deploy scraper to Pakistan-based server

## Immediate Action Required

**User needs to provide ONE of the following:**

1. ✅ **Test if YOU can access dps.psx.com.pk from your location**
   - If yes: Save page HTML and send to me
   - If no: We need alternative data source

2. ✅ **Alternative API/Data Source**
   - Do you have API credentials?
   - Do you know a working data source?

3. ✅ **HTML Sample**
   - Visit https://dps.psx.com.pk/?page_id=30
   - View page source (Ctrl+U or Cmd+Option+U)
   - Save as HTML file
   - I'll build scraper from that

## Temporary Solution

While we resolve access issues, I'll:
1. ✅ Keep mock data working
2. ✅ Build scraper framework (ready to use)
3. ✅ Test Yahoo Finance as backup
4. ✅ Wait for your input on data access

## Timeline

- **If you can access PSX**: 2-4 hours to build scraper
- **If Yahoo Finance works**: 1-2 hours to integrate
- **If need alternative source**: 1-3 days depending on source

## Questions for User

1. **Can you access dps.psx.com.pk from your browser?**
2. **Do you have VPN or are you in Pakistan?**
3. **Do you have any API keys or credentials for PSX?**
4. **Should I try Yahoo Finance as backup?**
5. **Do you know any other reliable KSE100 data sources?**
